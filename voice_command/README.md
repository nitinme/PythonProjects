Please excuse any microphone issues on your end pressuing this program to not work. 

You must turn on your volume for this to work, and your computer's default microphone should be running. 


This program asks the user to say something, and then responds to it with a coded response. 

Please add more features to this code, as it is only the basic version. With other modules, you can make this program able to open websites!
